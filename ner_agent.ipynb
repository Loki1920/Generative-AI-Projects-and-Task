do i go into work?\\ndoctor: no. don\\'t go to work you could unknowinly spread the virus. we are all effectively on lock down and the sooner the better if you think you have it stay home, if you ave access to testing then get tested but we are running out of tests (to my knowledge) if you deteriorate send a message here and i will advise. do not go to work.\\n\\ntime:2024-04-18 00:00:00\\npatient: the symptoms of covid sound like my asthma symptoms when it flares up. so how would i know the difference?\\ndoctor: in brief: fever/flu like sx covid-19 is typically associated with flu like symptoms, fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath. if your shortness of breath does not improve with albuterol inhaler, please call your pcp right away. stay home, rest, drink fluids, monitor your temperature and avoid environmental triggers such as smoke and dust. would you like to video or text chat with me?\\n\\ntime:2024-04-10 00:00:00\\npatient: low grade fevers 99.8, constant trigger points that are tender to touch in trapezius muscles and muscles feel warm to touch, pointer finger, and middle finger on right hand are very sore, sore to open and close hand in those fingers, whats wrong?\\ndoctor: in brief: systemic infection fever and muscle pains could indicate systemic infection, likely viral, deoendiing on your travel history. right hand joint pains, if previously injured or arthritic, could be flared up by systemic infection.call your local nurse or doctor to get screened telephonically for influenza & corona viruses & malaria.colchicine and panado may help if gouty joint pains. would you like to video or text chat with me?\\n\\ntime:2024-04-09 00:00:00\\npatient: can a cool mist vaporizer help with the corona virus since it doesn’t like humidity?\\ndoctor: not particularly. the facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. .\\n\\ntime:2024-04-06 00:00:00\\npatient: body aching all of a sudden, head heavy and paining, sneezing, somewhat fever since yesterday.\\ndoctor: virus. symptoms could be either influenza or the covid 19 virus. call your local doctor to discuss these new changes in your health to determine what testing will,be needed, and steps you should take. at least for,now, treat the symptoms with acetaminophen (not ibuprofen) , cough syrup. isolate yourself away from other people, wear a mask to avoid spreading virus, sneeze into elbow, wash hands frequently.\\n\\ntime:2024-04-02 00:00:00\\npatient: i am recovering from double bilateral pneumonia in hospital 3 days. i m an rt so i knew i had to use incentive spirometer and nebulizers for 2 weeks i am 2 weeks post discharge. i have to wear 02 at night only .5 to. 1 liter to keep sats above 90. during the day i occasionally need o2 i am on medical leave for 4 weeks is this going to get easier to breath soon i am resting as much as possible. i don t have much choice rather rest than feel pain i. chest.\\ndoctor: thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern.pneumonia usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete recovery.your oxygen requirement is decreasing. this is suggestive of recovery. so you will definitely be alright after 4 weeks. so get done repeat chest x ray to see how much pneumonia is recovered.chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry are vital to achieve good lung functions after pneumonia.don\\'t worry, you will be alright.hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-26 00:00:00\\npatient: i am a 14 year old female that was recently diagnosed with a slight bit of pneumonia, i took the antibiotics that i was supposed to take: once a day for 6 days, i completed it. but i want to know if i\\'m know cured, it\\'s been a week or two since i finish the tablet treatment, how can i tell that i\\'m cured?\\ndoctor: thanks for your question on healthcare magic.i can understand your concern. if you are not having fever, cough or chest pain after completing antibiotics, you are probably cured from pneumonia. you are should also get done chest x ray. if recent chest x ray is showing normal results or resolving infiltration then you are cured from pneumonia. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-20 00:00:00\\npatient: my daughter has been sick with the flu for over a week and now has strep throat and pneumonia. she s saw her doctor, ran some tests and her white blood cell count keeps dropping. they just sent her to the er. what would cause her wbc to drop? i know there s probably a few reasons, but given this recent background of her health?? thank you. very worried mom\\ndoctor: hello,any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. and this is responsible for low wbc (white blood cells) count. so better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. she may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing wbcs. once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal wbc count. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar\\n\\ntime:2024-03-19 00:00:00\\npatient: what should i do if i feel sick, but am not sure if it\\'s coronavirus?\\ndoctor: symptoms. first, symptomatic treatment at home, plenty fluids and rest. also apply all the preventive measures of social distancing. but if you are aware of any possible contact with an infected person, it is difficult to breath, fever does not low with bath or paracetamol, you are diabetic or with another chronic disease like hypertension, clinical attention should be asked for as soon as possible.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-15 00:00:00\\npatient: if i have fever and coughing (even blood) and i havent been outside of the country, do i have corona virus?\\ndoctor: hard to guess. if you are living in an area affected with covid-19 pandemic certainly it arouse suspicion if you are infected. your age is aginst criteria. it may well be what you have is bronchitis or flu. isolate yourself and get in touch with your doctor preferably via telemedicine to find out about where you can be tested and your treatment path forward. .\\n\\ntime:2024-03-12 00:00:00\\npatient: my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is 74 yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given amoxicillin and clarithromycin but now she is being sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the other antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia\\ndoctor: thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. so you should stop amoxicillin. there are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. and left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. so antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother.thanks.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-04 00:00:00\\npatient: i was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore i went back to the gp who then gave me clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. i have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. i had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as i was out of breath and wheezy. i still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. i have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if i am going backwards again instead of improving. i am 45 years old. non-smoker.this is the 3rd time i have had pneumonia in 18 years. i am reasonably fit and healthy, and i don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever i come down with something, i seem to suffer with it. how long does it take to get back to normal? are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would i need to see the gp again. i am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. i am taking a tonic (metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.\\ndoctor: hi, yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however i recommend you to do a chest ct to see if the pneumonia has gone completely. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. regards, dr. jnikolla, pulmonologist\\n\\ntime:2024-02-23 00:00:00\\npatient: my 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in august. her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. how dangerous and how can i increase the level. hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. she has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.\\ndoctor: low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? if so, then i would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. if she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then i would suggest urgent medical evaluation. i hope she feels better.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-16 00:00:00\\npatient: true or false? anyone infected with covid-19 start have diarrhea and increases the chances of death compared to person who just start respiratory symptoms, why?\\ndoctor: data. from data from china there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea. the seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-14 00:00:00\\npatient: i’m absolutely worried sick about getting coronavirus and what it would mean for me if i got it, because of my diabetes. is there anything you can say that can help me in any way? my anxiety is so high. thank you.\\ndoctor: take care. 1. wash your hands2. stay home as much as you can3. control your glucose levels4. meditate or search for breathing exercises.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-09 00:00:00\\npatient: can covid19 cause shortness of breath without a cough?\\ndoctor: yes. there are many causes of shortness of breath. covid-19 may be one cause and is not necessarily associated with cough. fever is one prominent symptom, but the absence of fever does not rule out the infection. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-06 00:00:00\\npatient: about the ibuprofen and covid 19 should i quit taking it? it’s got me paranoid. the way the media’s been tal',\n",

i know there s probably a few reasons, but given this recent background of her health?? thank you. very worried mom\\ndoctor: hello,any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. and this is responsible for low wbc (white blood cells) count. so better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. she may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing wbcs. once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal wbc count. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar\\n\\ntime:2024-03-19 00:00:00\\npatient: what should i do if i feel sick, but am not sure if it\\'s coronavirus?\\ndoctor: symptoms. first, symptomatic treatment at home, plenty fluids and rest. also apply all the preventive measures of social distancing. but if you are aware of any possible contact with an infected person, it is difficult to breath, fever does not low with bath or paracetamol, you are diabetic or with another chronic disease like hypertension, clinical attention should be asked for as soon as possible.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-15 00:00:00\\npatient: if i have fever and coughing (even blood) and i havent been outside of the country, do i have corona virus?\\ndoctor: hard to guess. if you are living in an area affected with covid-19 pandemic certainly it arouse suspicion if you are infected. your age is aginst criteria. it may well be what you have is bronchitis or flu. isolate yourself and get in touch with your doctor preferably via telemedicine to find out about where you can be tested and your treatment path forward. .\\n\\ntime:2024-03-12 00:00:00\\npatient: my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is 74 yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given amoxicillin and clarithromycin but now she is being sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the other antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia\\ndoctor: thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. so you should stop amoxicillin. there are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. and left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. so antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother.thanks.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-04 00:00:00\\npatient: i was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore i went back to the gp who then gave me clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. i have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. i had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as i was out of breath and wheezy. i still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. i have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if i am going backwards again instead of improving. i am 45 years old. non-smoker.this is the 3rd time i have had pneumonia in 18 years. i am reasonably fit and healthy, and i don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever i come down with something, i seem to suffer with it. how long does it take to get back to normal? are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would i need to see the gp again. i am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. i am taking a tonic (metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.\\ndoctor: hi, yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however i recommend you to do a chest ct to see if the pneumonia has gone completely. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. regards, dr. jnikolla, pulmonologist\\n\\ntime:2024-02-23 00:00:00\\npatient: my 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in august. her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. how dangerous and how can i increase the level. hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. she has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.\\ndoctor: low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? if so, then i would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. if she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then i would suggest urgent medical evaluation. i hope she feels better.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-16 00:00:00\\npatient: true or false? anyone infected with covid-19 start have diarrhea and increases the chances of death compared to person who just start respiratory symptoms, why?\\ndoctor: data. from data from china there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea. the seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-14 00:00:00\\npatient: i’m absolutely worried sick about getting coronavirus and what it would mean for me if i got it, because of my diabetes. is there anything you can say that can help me in any way? my anxiety is so high. thank you.\\ndoctor: take care. 1. wash your hands2. stay home as much as you can3. control your glucose levels4. meditate or search for breathing exercises.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-09 00:00:00\\npatient: can covid19 cause shortness of breath without a cough?\\ndoctor: yes. there are many causes of shortness of breath. covid-19 may be one cause and is not necessarily associated with cough. fever is one prominent symptom, but the absence of fever does not rule out the infection. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-06 00:00:00\\npatient: about the ibuprofen and covid 19 should i quit taking it?

i know there s probably a few reasons, but given this recent background of her health?? thank you. very worried mom\\ndoctor: hello,any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. and this is responsible for low wbc (white blood cells) count. so better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. she may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing wbcs. once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal wbc count. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further.regards,dr. kaushal bhavsar\\n\\ntime:2024-03-19 00:00:00\\npatient: what should i do if i feel sick, but am not sure if it\\'s coronavirus?\\ndoctor: symptoms. first, symptomatic treatment at home, plenty fluids and rest. also apply all the preventive measures of social distancing. but if you are aware of any possible contact with an infected person, it is difficult to breath, fever does not low with bath or paracetamol, you are diabetic or with another chronic disease like hypertension, clinical attention should be asked for as soon as possible.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-15 00:00:00\\npatient: if i have fever and coughing (even blood) and i havent been outside of the country, do i have corona virus?\\ndoctor: hard to guess. if you are living in an area affected with covid-19 pandemic certainly it arouse suspicion if you are infected. your age is aginst criteria. it may well be what you have is bronchitis or flu. isolate yourself and get in touch with your doctor preferably via telemedicine to find out about where you can be tested and your treatment path forward. .\\n\\ntime:2024-03-12 00:00:00\\npatient: my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is 74 yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given amoxicillin and clarithromycin but now she is being sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the other antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia\\ndoctor: thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. in my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. so you should stop amoxicillin. there are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. and left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. so antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother.thanks.\\n\\ntime:2024-03-04 00:00:00\\npatient: i was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore i went back to the gp who then gave me clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. i have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. i had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as i was out of breath and wheezy. i still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. i have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if i am going backwards again instead of improving. i am 45 years old. non-smoker.this is the 3rd time i have had pneumonia in 18 years. i am reasonably fit and healthy, and i don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever i come down with something, i seem to suffer with it. how long does it take to get back to normal? are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would i need to see the gp again. i am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. i am taking a tonic (metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.\\ndoctor: hi, yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however i recommend you to do a chest ct to see if the pneumonia has gone completely. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. regards, dr. jnikolla, pulmonologist\\n\\ntime:2024-02-23 00:00:00\\npatient: my 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in august. her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. how dangerous and how can i increase the level. hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. she has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.\\ndoctor: low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? if so, then i would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. if she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then i would suggest urgent medical evaluation. i hope she feels better.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-16 00:00:00\\npatient: true or false? anyone infected with covid-19 start have diarrhea and increases the chances of death compared to person who just start respiratory symptoms, why?\\ndoctor: data. from data from china there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea. the seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-14 00:00:00\\npatient: i’m absolutely worried sick about getting coronavirus and what it would mean for me if i got it, because of my diabetes. is there anything you can say that can help me in any way? my anxiety is so high. thank you.\\ndoctor: take care. 1. wash your hands2. stay home as much as you can3. control your glucose levels4. meditate or search for breathing exercises.\\n\\ntime:2024-02-09 00:00:00\\npatient: can covid19 cause shortness of breath without a cough?\\ndoctor: yes. there are many causes of shortness of breath. covid-19 may be one cause and is not necessarily associated with cough. fever is one prominent symptom, but the absence of fever does not rule out the infection. .\\n\\ntime:2024-02-06 00:00:00\\npatient: about the ibuprofen and covid 19 should i quit taking it? it’s got me paranoid. the way the media’s been tal'),\n",
